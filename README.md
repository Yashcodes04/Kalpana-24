24-hour hackathon organized by IEEE PESU-ECC Student branch. During the hackathon, we developed a website called Lifeline Connect. This website consists of two phases:

Blood Donation Phase: In this phase, we acted as an intermediary between hospitals, blood banks, and donors. Our aim was to create a platform similar to Swiggy or Zomato but for blood. We facilitated the process of finding nearby blood banks during emergencies and organized blood donation camps to encourage people to donate blood.

Consultancy Model: The second phase of our website involves a consultancy model. Here, users can input their medical reports, and the system generates a brief summary for doctors to review. Our future plan involves training a machine learning model to enhance this feature. This ML model would not only provide summaries of medical reports but also detect diseases, aiming for higher accuracy and efficiency.

Overall, our experience at the hackathon was both challenging and rewarding, and we are excited about the potential impact of Lifeline Connect in the healthcareÂ industry
